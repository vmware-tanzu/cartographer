# Developer

Here you'll find all that the developer needs to submit to Kubernetes to have
its code going through the software supply chain defined by the app operators.

- a workload with
  - location of the source code
  - name of the service account that provides permission to deploy templated objects
  - environment variables for the build process

Note: The examples/shared directory also contains developer resources.
