# `tekton-taskrun` has the template for the object that will be created
# by a Runnable that references this ClusterRunTemplate. It defines a
# tekton taskRun and expects inputs from the runnable (e.g. runnable.spec.inputs.params)
# It finally specifies what outputs will be on the status of the Runnable
# object (i.e. `url` and `revision`)
