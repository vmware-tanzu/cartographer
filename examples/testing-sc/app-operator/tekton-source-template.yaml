# `test` instantiates a Runnable object, responsible for submitting to
# Kubernetes "pipeline invocation objects" (tekton's PipelineRun objects) that
# run tests against the source code.
#
# Taking a `source` as input and passing that through as `output` if
# successfull makes this template a gate that will effectively block a given
# commit from moving forward in the supply chain in case tests fail.
