# cluster setup

Aside from having [cartographer] installed in the cluster, here we also
pre-load a secret with some credentials so anyone running this example can get
[kpack] to build and push the image to a sample repository in
https://harbor-repo.vmware.com.

Nothing interesting to see here regarding cartographer.
