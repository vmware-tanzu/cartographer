Cartographer is a Kubernetes-native [Choreographer] providing higher modularity and scalability for the software supply chain.

[Learn more about Cartographer](https://cartographer.sh/docs/latest/)

[Choreographer]: https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/supply-chain-choreography/

## Getting Started

Examples of using Cartographer can be found in the
[examples folder of this repository](examples/README.md).
The examples begin by demonstrating how to define a Supply Chain that pulls code from a repository,
builds an image for the code, and deploys in the same cluster. Enhancements of that example
(e.g. adding tests) are then demonstrated.
## Installation

### Pre requisites
1. Administrative capabilities in a Kubernetes cluster (1.19+)
2. [cert-manager](https://cartographer.sh/docs/v0.0.7/install/) 1.5.3 installed

The quickest method to install Cartographer leverages the `cartographer.yaml` file provided with each release:

1. Create the namespace where the controller will be installed:

```bash
kubectl create namespace cartographer-system
```
2. Submit the objects included in the release:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/releases/latest/download/cartographer.yaml
```
And you're done!
