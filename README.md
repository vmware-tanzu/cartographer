## Getting Started

Examples of using Cartographer can be found in the
[examples folder of this repository](examples/README.md).
The examples begin by demonstrating how to define a Supply Chain that pulls code from a repository,
builds an image for the code, and deploys in the same cluster. Enhancements of that example
(e.g. adding tests) are then demonstrated.
