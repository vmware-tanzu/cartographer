# Cartographer
<img src="site/themes/template/static/img/cartographer-logo.png">

Cartographer is a Kubernetes native [Choreographer]. It allows users to configure K8s resources into re-usable [_Supply Chains_](site/content/docs/reference.md#ClusterSupplyChain) that can be used to define all of the stages that an [_Application Workload_](site/content/docs/reference.md#Workload) must go through to get to an environment.

[Choreographer]: https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/supply-chain-choreography/

Cartographer also allows for separation of controls between a user who is responsible for defining a Supply Chain (known as a App Operator) and a user who is focused on creating applications (Developer). These roles are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but provide the ability to create a separation concern.

## Known Issues
- **WARNING!!** At this time, the Supply Chain ClusterRoleBinding has more permissions than it needs. This will be fixed in an upcoming release.
The issue can be tracked [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/issues/51).

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for Cartographer can be found in the `site` folder of this repository:

* [About Cartographer](site/content/docs/about.md): Details the design and philosophy of Cartographer
* [Examples](examples/source-to-knative-service/README.md): Contains an example of using Cartographer to create a supply chain that takes a repository, creates and image and deploys it to a cluster
* [Spec Reference](site/content/docs/reference.md): Detailed descriptions of the CRD Specs for Cartographer

## Installation


### Pre requisites
1. Administrative capabilities in a Kubernetes cluster (1.19+)
2. [cert-manager](https://cartographer.sh/docs/v0.0.7/install/) 1.5.3 installed

The quickest method to install Cartographer leverages the `cartographer.yaml` file provided with each release:

1. Create the namespace where the controller will be installed:

```bash
kubectl create namespace cartographer-system
```
2. Submit the objects included in the release:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/releases/latest/download/cartographer.yaml
```

And you're done!

Additional installation methods are detailed in the documentation at [cartographer.sh/docs/install](http://cartographer.sh/docs/install)
## Getting Started

An example of using Cartographer to define a Supply Chain that pulls code from a repository, builds an image for the code and deploys it the the same cluster can be found in the [examples folder of this repository](examples/source-to-knative-service/README.md)
