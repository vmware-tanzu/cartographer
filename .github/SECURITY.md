# Security Policy

The VMware Security Response Centre Team provides a single point of contact for
the reporting of security vulnerabilities in VMware products and coordinates
the process of investigating any reported vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We strongly encourage people to report security vulnerabilities privately to
our security team before disclosing them in a public forum.

The e-mail address to use to contact the team is **security@vmware.com**.

Please note that the e-mail address above should only be used for reporting
undisclosed security vulnerabilities in VMware products and managing the
process of fixing such vulnerabilities. We cannot accept regular bug reports or
other security related queries at this address.

If you wish to send encrypted email, make sure you check out
