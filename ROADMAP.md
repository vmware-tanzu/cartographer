This document provides an overview of the major themes driving Cartographer development, as well as constituent features and capabilities. Most items are gathered from the community or include a feedback loop with the community. We hope this will serve as a reference point for Cartographer users and contributors to help us prioritize existing features, provide input on unmet needs, and understand where the project is heading, especially if a contribution may be conflicting with longer term plans. 

If it does conflict, the team and community will need to determine whether to adjust the roadmap or recommend changes to the contribution idea.

**How to Help**

Discussion on the roadmap can take place in threads under [Issues](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/issues) or in [community meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HwsjzxpsNI0l1sVAUia4A65lhrkfSF-_XfKoZUHI120/edit?usp=sharing). Please open and comment on an issue if you want to provide suggestions, use cases, and feedback to an item in the roadmap. Community members are encouraged to be actively involved, and also stay informed so contributions can be made with the most positive effect and limited duplication of effort.
 
If you'd like to contribute (thank you!!) but don't have anything to propose (all good!), check out our issues for issues tagged [good-first-issue](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/labels/good%20first%20issue) or say hi in the [#cartographer](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C02HKPSEKV1) Slack channel - weâ€™re always happy to have an impromptu chat!.

**How to add an item to the roadmap**

Please create an issue using the [Feature Request](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request_template.md) template to propose a feature for the project. We rely on our community to help us detail out and prioritize our efforts to improve Cartographer. 
Also feel free to submit a pull request against your issue for feedback from the  community!

**Current roadmap**

The following table includes the current roadmap for Cartographer. Please take the timelines & dates as proposals and goals. Priorities and requirements change based on community feedback, roadblocks encountered, community contributions, etc. If you depend on a specific item, we encourage you to attend community meetings to get updated status information, or help us deliver that feature by contributing!

**Other areas being explored**

* Connecting K8s objects to workloads (secrets, config maps, volumes, etc)
* Supply Chain supported Delivery verification (support smoke test on deployment)
* Alerting
* Fan In / Fan Out - from git repo to multiple clusters for different purposes, from multiple clusters to a single git repository. ex staging cluster + performance test cluster
* CloudEvent trigger - cleaner interoperability between different types of tooling, recieving CloudEvents ex if a Nexus supports webhooks, we dont have to do polling, like the image registry fires events
