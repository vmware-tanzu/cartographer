Since October 2021, when the Cartographer project was made public, we have been very fortunate to count on individual
contributors who have helped improve the codebase and docs while also telling the Cartographer story at conferences, in
live streams and other forms of content. All of them have done this out of an intrinsic motivation, without expecting
any reward or public recognition. We are forever grateful to them for this.

Nevertheless, we would like to fill in the
[extrinsic motivation](https://www.rochester.edu/emerging-leaders/understanding-intrinsic-and-extrinsic-motivation/#:~:text=Intrinsic%20motivation%20involves%20performing%20a,punishment%20or%20receiving%20a%20reward)
void by rolling out a small initiative called **Contributor of the Month**

**How does it work?**

We plan to recognize contributors in three different categories:

- Code contributor (merged PRs)
- Content creator (tweets/blog posts/screencasts/presentations/podcasts)
- Community advocate (participation on community meetings/providing user feedback/creating or commenting Slack
  interactions,Github discussions or issues)

Code contributions will be tracked using the `contributor shoutouter` program located in
[this repo](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-engagement/tree/main/shoutouter) while content and community
support will be tracked by the Cartographer community team.

As a little token of appreciation, contributors will receive Cartographer branded, sustainable swag that we hope you
find useful.

Also, public shoutouts will be done at the first
[Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HwsjzxpsNI0l1sVAUia4A65lhrkfSF-_XfKoZUHI120/edit?usp=sharing) of
the following month and on the [@OssCartographer](https://twitter.com/OssCartographer) Twitter account.
