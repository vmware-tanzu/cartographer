## What is this?

I recently decided I wanted JSON Schemas for all of Cartographer's CRDs. That way I'd be less likely to make mistakes
and need to wait until I had done a `kubectl apply` and waited for a **workload** failure to discover that I had
forgotten something important.

I wrote a little bit of code to generate JSON Schemas
from [Cartographer CRD manifests](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/tree/main/config/crd/bases). I plan on
releasing it as a formal utility that folks can use to create JSON Schemas for any OpenAPIV3 CRD Schemas, but I
realised **schema validation is not enough**.

So I've created the [Live Editor](/live-editor/index.html).

Today the editor:

* Only supports SupplyChains.
* Visualises the supply chain.
* AutoSuggests based on schema.
* Validates based on schema.
* AutoSuggests inputs from existing resources.
* Let's you copy the URL to share your yaml with others.

In the future I'd like to add:

* Support for all the CRDs
* Syntax checking for invalid references (coming soon!)
* Display `options` selected by a workload (part of a new set of RFCs to support multiple paths in a supply chain)
* Instances of the editor inline in the docs
* Links in example CRs to editable/visualized versions of the same CR
* Read/Write GitHub Gists to support loading and editing templates + blueprints + owners
* Much more!

I want to know what you think! Please let us know if this is something that's valuable to you.
