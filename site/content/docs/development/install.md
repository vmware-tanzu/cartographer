# Installing Cartographer

There are three recommended ways of installing Cartographer:

1. with a single YAML file (quick!)
2. using an [imgpkg bundle], making easier for relocation
3. using a [carvel Packaging] objects, for an opinionated package-based
   workflow

If all you want to do is get started quick and fetching images from DockerHub
is not an issue, [`1`](#1-single-file-quick-install) is the way to go.
Otherwise, check out the other approaches (especially if you want to have
everything relocated to a registry of your own).

tl;dr _(having [cert-manager] already installed)_:

```bash
kubectl create namespace cartographer-system
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/releases/latest/download/cartographer.yaml
```


## Pre-requisites

### Admin capabilities in a recent-enough Kubernetes cluster (v1.19+)

Currently, Cartographer doesn't provide support for granular permissions (see
[#51]), as such, to configure the supply chain (which is cluster-wide), you
must have admin capabilities in the cluster you're targetting.

### [cert-manager] for managing the controller's certificates

In order to have Cartographer's validation webhooks up and running in the
cluster, [cert-manager] is utilized to generate TLS certificates as well to keep
them up to date.

First, verify if you have the dependency installed:

```bash
kubectl get crds certificates.cert-manager.io
```
```console
NAME                           CREATED AT
certificates.cert-manager.io   2021-08-27T18:41:40Z
```

In case you don't (i.e., you see _""certificates.cert-manager.io" not found"_),
proceed with installing it.

```bash
CERT_MANAGER_VERSION=1.5.3

kapp deploy --yes -a cert-manager \
	-f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v$CERT_MANAGER_VERSION/cert-manager.yaml
```
```console
Target cluster 'https://127.0.0.1:39495' (nodes: kind-control-plane)

Changes
Namespace     Name                     Kind               ...
(cluster)     cert-manager             Namespace          ...
^             cert-manager-cainjector  ClusterRole        ...

7:53:32AM: ---- applying complete [6/6 done] ----
7:53:32AM: ---- waiting complete [6/6 done] ----

Succeeded
```

ps.: although we recommend using [kapp] as provided in the instructions you'll
see here, its use can be replaced by `kubectl apply`.


## 1. Single file, Quick install

Cartographer releases include a file (`cartographer.yaml`) that contains all
necessary files for installing it in a cluster

```console
Resources in file './bundle/cartographer.yaml'

Namespace            Name                              Kind
(cluster)            cartographer-cluster-admin        ClusterRoleBinding
^                    clusterconfigtemplates.carto.run  CustomResourceDefinition
^                    clusterimagetemplates.carto.run   CustomResourceDefinition
^                    clustersourcetemplates.carto.run  CustomResourceDefinition
^                    clustersupplychains.carto.run     CustomResourceDefinition
^                    clustersupplychainvalidator       ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
^                    clustertemplates.carto.run        CustomResourceDefinition
^                    runnables.carto.run               CustomResourceDefinition
^                    runtemplates.carto.run            CustomResourceDefinition
^                    workloads.carto.run               CustomResourceDefinition

cartographer-system  cartographer-controller           Deployment
^                    cartographer-controller           ServiceAccount
^                    cartographer-webhook              Certificate
^                    cartographer-webhook              Secret
^                    cartographer-webhook              Service
^                    private-registry-credentials      Secret
^                    selfsigned-issuer                 Issuer
```


providing all the necessary objects that would entail a full installation of
it.

To install it, first create the namespace where the controller will be
installed:

```bash
kubectl create namespace cartographer-system
```
```console
namespace/cartographer-system created
```

and then, submit the objects included in the release:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/releases/latest/download/cartographer.yaml
```
```console
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/clusterconfigtemplates.carto.run configured
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/clusterimagetemplates.carto.run configured
...
secret/cartographer-webhook created
```


## 2. Bundle tarball

This installation method is great for those that want to host Cartographer's
image and installation objects by themselves - either so they live in a public
container image registry of their own, or for air-gapped scenarios where bits
need to be moved in an offline fashion.

First, head to the [releases page] and download the `bundle.tar` file available
for the release you want to install.

```bash
curl -SOL https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/releases/latest/download/bundle.tar
```

This bundle contains everything we need to install Cartographer, from container
images to Kubernetes manifests, it's all in the bundle.

First, relocate it from the tarball you just downloaded to a container image
registry that the  cluster you're willing to install Cartographer has access
to:


```bash
# set the repository where images should be reloated to, for instance, to
# relocate to a project named "foo" in DockerHub: DOCKER_REPO=foo
#
DOCKER_REPO=10.188.0.3:5000


# relocate
#
imgpkg copy \
  --tar bundle.tar \
  --to-repo ${DOCKER_REPO?:Required}/cartographer-bundle \
  --lock-output cartographer-bundle.lock.yaml
```
```console
copy | importing 2 images...
copy | done uploading images
Succeeded
```

With the the bundle and all Cartographer-related images moved to the destination
registry, we can move on to pulling the YAML files that we can use to submit to
Kubernetes for installing Cartographer:


```bash
# pull to the directory `cartographer-bundle` the contents of the imgpkg
# bundle as specified by the lock file.
#
imgpkg pull \
  --lock cartographer-bundle.lock.yaml \
  --output ./cartographer-bundle
```
```console
Pulling bundle '10.188.0.3:5000/cartographer-bundle@sha256:e296a316385a57048cb189a3a710cecf128a62e77600a495f32d46309c6e8113'
  Extracting layer 'sha256:0b93d1878c9be97b872f08da8d583796985919df345c39c874766142464d80e7' (1/1)

Locating image lock file images...
The bundle repo (10.188.0.3:5000/cartographer-bundle) is hosting every image specified in the bundle's Images Lock file (.imgpkg/images.yml)

Succeeded
```

Create the namespace where Cartographer's objects will be placed:

```bash
kubectl create namespace cartographer-system
```
```console
namespace/cartographer-system created
```

If the registry you pushed the bundle to is accessible to the cluster without
any extra authentication needs, skip this step. Otherwise, make sure you
provide to the `Deployment` object that runs the controller the image pull
secrets necessary for fetching the image.

By default, the controller's ServiceAccount points at a placeholder secret
called 'private-registry-credentials' to be used as the image pull secret, so,
by creating such secret in the `cartographer-system` namespace Kubernetes will
then be able to use that secret as the credenital provider for fetching the
controller's image:

```bash
# create a secret that will have .dockerconfigjson populated with the
# credentials for the image registry.
#
kubectl create secret -n cartographer-system \
  docker-registry private-registry-credentials \
  --docker-server=$DOCKER_REPO \
  --docker-username=admin \
  --docker-password=admin
```
```console
secret/private-registry-credentials created
```

Now that we have the Kubernetes YAML under the `./cartographer-bundle`
directory, we can make use of a combination of `kbld` and `kapp` to submit the
Kubernetes the final objects that will define the installation of Cartographer
already pointing all the image references to your registry:


```bash
# submit to kubernetes the kubernetes objects that describe the installation of
# Cartographer already pointing all images to the registry we configured
# ($DOCKER_REPO).
#
kapp deploy -a cartographer -f <(kbld -f ./cartographer-bundle)
```
```console

on how to create a Secret to pull images from a private Docker registry or
repository)._


## 3. Installation using Carvel Packaging

Another way that you can go about installing Cartographer is with the use of
[carvel Packaging] provided by [kapp-controller]. These, when used alongside
[secretgen controller], provide a great experience for, in a declarative way,
installing Cartographer.

To make use of them, first, make sure those pre-requisites above are satified


### Prerequisites

1. admin access to a Kubernetes Cluster and [cert-manager]

2. [kapp-controller] is already installed in the cluster

```bash
kubectl get crd packageinstalls.packaging.carvel.dev
```
```console
NAME                                   CREATED AT
packageinstalls.packaging.carvel.dev   2021-09-13T14:32:00Z
```

In case you don't (i.e., you see _"packageinstalls.packaging.carvel.dev" not
found_), proceed with installing it.

```bash
KAPP_CONTROLLER_VERSION=0.30.0

kapp deploy --yes -a kapp-controller \
  -f https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp-controller/releases/download/v$KAPP_CONTROLLER_VERSION/release.yml
```
```console

```

3. [secretgen controller] installed

```bash
kubectl get crd secretexports.secretgen.carvel.dev
```
```console
NAME                                 CREATED AT
secretexports.secretgen.carvel.dev   2021-09-20T18:10:10Z
```

In case you don't (i.e., you see _"secretexports.secretgen.carvel.dev" not
found_), proceed with installing it.

```bash
SECRETGEN_CONTROLLER_VERSION=0.6.0

kapp deploy --yes -a secretgen-controller \
  -f https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-secretgen-controller/releases/download/v$SECRETGEN_CONTROLLER_VERSION/release.yml

6:13:25PM: ---- applying complete [11/11 done] ----
6:13:25PM: ---- waiting complete [11/11 done] ----

Succeeded
```


3. the `default` service account has the capabilities necessary for installing
   submitting all those objects above to the cluster


```bash
kubectl create clusterrolebinding default-cluster-admin \
	--clusterrole=cluster-admin \
	--serviceaccount=default:default
```
```console
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/default-cluster-admin created
```

### Package installation

With the prerequisites satisfied, go ahead and download the `package*` files,
as well as the `imgpkg` bundle:

```bash
CARTOGRAPHER_VERSION=v0.0.6

curl -SOL https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/releases/download/v$CARTOGRAPHER_VERSION/bundle.tar
curl -SOL https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/releases/download/v$CARTOGRAPHER_VERSION/package.yaml
curl -SOL https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/releases/download/v$CARTOGRAPHER_VERSION/package-metadata.yaml
curl -SOL https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/releases/download/v$CARTOGRAPHER_VERSION/package-install.yaml
```

First, relocate the bundle:

```bash
# set the repository where images should be reloated to, for instance, to
# relocate to a project named "foo" in DockerHub: DOCKER_REPO=foo
#
DOCKER_REPO=10.188.0.3:5000


# relocate
#
imgpkg copy \
  --tar bundle.tar \
  --to-repo ${DOCKER_REPO?:Required}/cartographer-bundle \
  --lock-output cartographer-bundle.lock.yaml
```

Now that the bundle is in our repository, update the Package object to point at
it (use the image from `cartographer-bundle.lock.yaml`):


```diff
  apiVersion: data.packaging.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
  kind: Package
  ..
    template:
      spec:
        fetch:
        - imgpkgBundle:
-           image: IMAGE
+           image: 10.188.0.3:5000/cartographer-bundle@sha256:e296a3163
        template:
```

That done, submit the packaging objects to Kubernetes so that `kapp-controller`
will materialize them into an installation of Cartographer:


```bash
kapp deploy --yes -a cartographer \
  -f ./package-metadata.yaml \
  -f ./package.yaml \
  -f ./package-install.yaml
```
```console
Target cluster 'https://127.0.0.1:42483' (nodes: cartographer-control-plane)

```

if you relocated the images here to a private registry that requires
authentication, make sure you create a `Secret` with the credentials to the
registry as well as a `SecretExport` object to make those credentials
available to other namespaces.


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: shared-registry-credentials
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson # needs to be this type
stringData:
  .dockerconfigjson: |
    {
            "auths": {
                    "<registry>": {
                            "username": "<username>",
                            "password": "<password>"
                    }
            }
    }
