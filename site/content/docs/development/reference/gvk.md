# GVK

## Version

All of the custom resources that Cartographer is working on are being written under `v1alpha1` to indicate that our
first version of it is at the "alpha stability level", and that it's our first iteration on it.

See
[Versions in CustomResourceDefinitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/)

## Group

All of our custom resources under the `carto.run` group.

For instance:

```yaml
apiVersion: carto.run/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterSupplyChain
```
