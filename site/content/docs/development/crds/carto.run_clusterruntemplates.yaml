  # Outputs are a named list of jsonPaths that are used to gather
  # results from the last successful object stamped by the
  # template. E.g: 	my-output:
  # .status.results[?(@.name=="IMAGE-DIGEST")].value Note: outputs
  # are only filled on the runnable when the templated object has
  # a Succeeded condition with a Status of True E.g:    
  # status.conditions[?(@.type=="Succeeded")].status == True a
  # runnable creating an object without a Succeeded condition
  # (like a Job or ConfigMap) will never display an output

  # Template defines a resource template for a Kubernetes Resource
  # or Custom Resource which is applied to the server each time
  # the blueprint is applied. Templates support simple value
  # interpolation using the $()$ marker format. For more
  # information, see:
  # https://cartographer.sh/docs/latest/templating/ You should not
  # define the namespace for the resource - it will automatically
  # be created in the owner namespace. If the namespace is
  # specified and is not the owner namespace, the resource will
  # fail to be created.
