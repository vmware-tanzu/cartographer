spec:

  # ImagePath is a path into the templated object's data that
  # contains a valid image digest. This might be a URL or in some
  # cases just a repository path and digest. The final spec for
  # this field may change as we implement RFC-0016
  # https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer/blob/main/rfc/rfc-0016-validate-template-outputs.md
  # ImagePath is specified in jsonpath format, eg:
  # .status.artifact.image_digest
  imagePath: <string>

  # Additional parameters. See:
  # https://cartographer.sh/docs/latest/architecture/#parameter-hierarchy
  # +optional
  params:
    - # DefaultValue of the parameter. Causes the parameter to be
      # optional; If the Owner or Template does not specify this
      # parameter, this value is used.
      default: <any>

      # Name of a parameter the template accepts from the
      # Blueprint or Owner.
      name: <string>

  # Template defines a resource template for a Kubernetes Resource
  # or Custom Resource which is applied to the server each time
  # the blueprint is applied. Templates support simple value
  # interpolation using the $()$ marker format. For more
  # information, see:
  # https://cartographer.sh/docs/latest/templating/ You cannot
  # define both Template and Ytt at the same time.
  # +optional
  template: {}

  # Ytt defines a resource template written in `ytt` for a
  # Kubernetes Resource or Custom Resource which is applied to the
  # server each time the blueprint is applied. Templates support
  # simple value interpolation using the $()$ marker format. For
  # more information, see:
